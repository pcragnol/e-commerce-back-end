## Usage

To use this application, you must first install Node.js and MySQL. Then, install necessary dependencies with the following command:

```
npm i
```

Then create a .env file that includes your MySQL username and password with the following command:

```
cp .env.EXAMPLE .env
```

Then create and seed the database with following commands:

```
mysql -uroot -p
source db/schema.sql
exit
npm run seed
```

Now you may start the application with the following command:

```
node server.js
```

There is currently no front end for this application, so you must use Insomnia execute all requests.
